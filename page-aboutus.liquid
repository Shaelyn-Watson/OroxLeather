<p id="p-centered">    In 1933 Felipe Martinez began crafting leather goods in Oaxaca, Mexico. Felipe made traditional sandals (huaraches) and also equipment for his own Oaxacan baseball team: Casa Audelo. He taught his son, Don Pepe, who in turn taught his son, José to make rustic products that last forever.<br /><br />    When José was growing up his favorite artist was Rod Stewart and he desperately wanted his own pair of brightly colored shoes (just like the ones Rod wore). José asked his father, whose pragmatic and generous response was to buy him the materials and teach him how to make his own. They turned out so well that José made several more pairs and sold them in the local market – his first design and entrepreneurial success. </p>

<p id="p-centered">    Although José is one of fourteen children, he was the only one to continue in the family trade. José was intent on improving his craft and finding new audiences, so he exhibited his work throughout Mexico.<br /> <br />    While exhibiting near Mexico City José’s work caught the attention of a Japanese buyer and businessman. Eventually, José received a job offer and he traveled to Japan where he worked for six years as a master leather worker in residence at, of all places, a Wild-West theme park. There José was free to create his own designs and he learned new approaches towards working with leather. He was influenced by the Japanese reverence for craft, their minimalist aesthetic, and their appreciation of beautiful, everyday items. <br /><br />    The six years in Japan expanded José’s horizons and instilled in him a love of Japanese food and culture. In Japan, his neighbors taught him to make sashimi and okonomiyaki (a grilled Japanese cabbage pizza) and he taught them about mole and chilaquiles. When he returned to Oaxaca City, that knowledge enabled José to open a successful sushi bar.</p>
<h1 style="margin-top: 50px;"><strong>ESTABLISHED IN PORTLAND</strong></h1>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0152/8389/files/sandals_now_large.jpg?11128278546566314910" />   <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0152/8389/files/water1_large.jpg?725575613829244471" /></div>
<p id="p-centered">    In 2005, Orox Leather Co. was born. José’s eldest son, Martin, while completing his degree in business from Portland State University, decided to talk to José and his father-in-law, John, about reviving the family leather crafting business. While walking from work, José happened to see a pile of discarded scrap rubber. This led him to create a new line of sandals that drew on traditional Mexican techniques but were more contemporary and stylish. </p>
<p id="p-centered">    Orox started small, with José and Martin making sandals in their garage and selling them at Saturday Market and crafts fairs. José soon realized that he needed a broader array of products, as sandal season in Oregon, even for the most optimistic and hearty, is limited. Orox began to design and craft our iconic purses, rucksacks, wallets and belts.<br /><br />    A few years later, José’s two other sons, Kevin and Levi, also joined Orox. With Orox’s retail and online businesses growing, we decided to open a store and workshop in Old Town, Portland to create an environment where you can meet the makers behind the brand.</p>

<h1 style="margin-top: 50px;"><strong>OUR STORE</strong></h1>
<div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0152/8389/files/MG_6000_large.jpg?78763706295245458" />   <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0152/8389/files/Orox_Leather_Co_-_Signing2_large.jpg?78763706295245458" /></div>
<div id="p-centered">    Orox’s retail store and workshop is located in Portland’s Old Town blocks in a lovingly restored industrial space. Our store opened in December 2012, after much work by the whole family and with assistance from the Portland Development Commission. We’re proud to be part of a resurgent Old Town and it’s great to see new businesses open and thrive.</div>
<div id="p-centered">    Upon entering our store, you’ll be greeted by the smell of uncut leather and well-oiled sewing machines. Half of the store is devoted to our retail shop and features rotating, seasonal displays of our products. The other half is our workshop and production floor where all of our products are designed and made. We configured our shop so that you can meet the people behind the brand and see our design and production processes. Similar to a restaurant with an open kitchen, you can look behind the counter and watch our products being made.  </div>
<h1 style="margin-top: 50px;"><strong> OUR PRODUCTS</strong></h1>

<div id="p-centered">    We create high quality, durable goods that while stylish don’t go in and out of style. We hope that our products will be used and loved for years, and eventually passed on to the next generation. Scratches and scuffs, a physical record of experiences and adventures, will add character and beauty. Leather an ever-changing material that was once alive, continues to evolve as it ages and acquires a patina of use. Making products that last is part of our Mexican heritage. In the 1960s and 1970s in Oaxaca fast-fashion didn’t exist and a pair of shoes or a belt needed to last a long, long time. With care our products will last for generations and become treasured heirlooms.<br /><br />    We continually design exciting new products and expand our offerings. Each season we introduce new styles with inspired, elegant design, often based on thoughtful feedback from customers and partners such as yourselves.<br /><br />    We are committed to creating products that last forever and that have minimal environmental impact. All our materials are US made, many from venerable manufacturers such as Horween Leather Company, Cone Denim Mills, and Martin Dyeing and Finishing Company. These high quality materials look great and are extremely durable.</div>
